 Getting Started

This project aims to help developers understand how to integrate Material UI V5 into a React project effectively. The project demonstrates several aspects of Material UI, such as layout components, form components, feedback components, and utilities for theming and customization.

To get started, explore the components within the `src/components` folder to understand how Material UI components are structured, customized, and managed.

 Usage

Once the application is running, explore different pages and interact with various components to see Material UI V5 in action. You can experiment with different themes and settings in `src/theme/theme.js`.

 Example Code

Below is a sample code snippet demonstrating how to add a Material UI Button with customized theming:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Button } from '@mui/material';

function CustomButton() {
  return (
    <Button variant="contained" color="primary">
      Click Me
    </Button>

}

export default CustomButton;
```
